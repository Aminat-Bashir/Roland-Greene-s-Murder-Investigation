# Roland Greene's Murder Investigation
This is a data-driven investigation into the murder of Roland Greene, a well-known art collector, who was found dead in the Vault Room of his private estate at 8:00 PM, shortly after receiving a call at 7:55 PM. Though all 30 guests claim to have alibis, someone or some people are lying.
